It is an AngularJS module to manage [HTTP Digest Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication) in the REST API web apps.
It provides functionality to avoid the default form of browsers and use your own. The login and logout are based on digest access authentication
and the module helps to manage the user identity in the client side.
You can use this module in order to protect your app and authorize the user to navigate inside it.

#Features
* Using your own login and logout
* Interceptor to pass the authorization in all further requests after the login
* Protection for login with a limitation for the number of requests
* Storage for reusing credentials
* Managing identity with `authIdentity` service
* Authorization checking as promise with `dgAuthService`
* Custom header to parse server information(realm, opaque, domain, etc...)
* Custom callbacks to handle all authorization states(login successful, login error, login required, etc...)

#Installation
You can download this by:
* Using bower and running `bower install angular-digest-auth --save` (recommended)
* Using npm: `npm install tafax/angular-digest-auth`
* Downloading manually the [unminified version](https://raw.github.com/tafax/angular-digest-auth/master/dist/angular-digest-auth.js) or
the [minified production version](https://raw.github.com/tafax/angular-digest-auth/master/dist/angular-digest-auth.min.js)

After installation, import the module in your app.
````javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['dgAuth']);
````

#Dependencies
This module depends by [angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), [angular-state-machine](https://github.com/tafax/angular-state-machine)
and [angular-md5](https://github.com/gdi2290/angular-md5).

#Configuration
You have to provide a few configurations in order to work.

###Login and logout
Create the services to sign in and sign out in order to simulate the login and
the logout in your app. `signin` service should return the JSON of the user identity.
You can use the user identity with `authIdentity` service.
````javascript
app.config(['dgAuthServiceProvider', function(dgAuthServiceProvider)
{
    dgAuthServiceProvider.setConfig({
        login: {
            method: 'POST',
            url: '/signin'
            ...
            //Other HTTP configurations.
        },
        logout: {
            method: 'POST',
            url: '/signout'
            ...
            //Other HTTP configurations.
        }
    });
}]);
````

###Header
How to configure the header to parse server information. You should define a custom header in the server side
in order to avoid the browser form and use your custom login form.
````javascript
app.config(['dgAuthServiceProvider', function(dgAuthServiceProvider)
{
    /**
     * Specifies the header to look for server information.
     * The header you have used in the server side.
     */
    dgAuthServiceProvider.setHeader('Your-Header-For-Authentication');
}]);
````

###Limit
How to configure the limit of number requests to sign in. When the limit is exceeded
`limit` of login callbacks is invoked. The default limit is 4.
N.B.: the limit includes the request to sign in place during the invocation of the `start` method.
````javascript
app.config(['dgAuthServiceProvider', function(dgAuthServiceProvider)
{
    /**
     * Sets the limit to 5 requests.
     * 4 requests after the invocation of start method.
     */
    dgAuthServiceProvider.setLimit(5);

    /**
     * Sets the limit of requests to infinite.
     */
    dgAuthServiceProvider.setLimit('inf');
}]);
````

###Calbacks
How to configure what happens at the user login and/or logout.
````javascript
app.config(['dgAuthServiceProvider', function(dgAuthServiceProvider)
{
    /**
     * You can add the callbacks to manage what happens after
     * successful of the login.
     */
    dgAuthServiceProvider.callbacks.login.push(['serviceInject', function(serviceInject)
    {
        return {
            successful: function(response)
            {
                //Your code...
            },
            error: function(response)
            {
                //Your code...
            },
            required: function(response)
            {
                //Your code...
            },
            limit: function(response)
            {
                //Your code...
            }
        };
    }]);

    //This is the same for the logout.

    /**
     * You can add the callbacks to manage what happens after
     * successful of the logout.
     */
    dgAuthServiceProvider.callbacks.logout.push(['serviceInject', function(serviceInject)
    {
        return {
            successful: function(response)
            {
                //Your code...
            },
            error: function(response)
            {
                //Your code...
            }
        };
    }]);
}]);
````

###Storage
By default, after the user has made the login, the credentials are stored in `sessionStorage` and the module
processes all further requests with this credentials. If you want to restore the user credentials when
he returns in your app, you can specify the `localStorage` as default storage.
````javascript
app.config(['dgAuthServiceProvider', function(dgAuthServiceProvider)
{
    /**
     * Uses localStorage instead the sessionStorage.
     */
    dgAuthServiceProvider.setStorage(localStorage);
}]);
````

Obviously, if you want to specify your own storage object, you can :).

#Usage
For basic usage, you can launch the `start()` when your app goes run.
````javascript
app.run(['dgAuthService', function(dgAuthService)
{
    /**
     * It tries to sign in. If the service doesn't find
     * the credentials stored or the user is not signed in yet,
     * the service executes the required function.
     */
    dgAuthService.start();
}]);
````

In your login controller you should provide the credentials submitted by user.
Then you have to sign in another time.
````javascript
$scope.submit = function(user)
{
    dgAuthService.setCredentials(user.username, user.password);
    dgAuthService.signin();
};
````

If the login is successful, all further requests, for the API in the domain specified by the server header,
contains the authentication to authorize the user.

#Authorization
You can use a functionality of `dgAuthService` to authorize the user to navigate in your app.
````javascript
app.config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider)
{
    /**
     * Use a variable in resolve to authorize the users.
     * The method 'isAuthorized()' returns a promise
     * which you can use to authorize the requests.
     */
    $routeProvider.when('some/path', {
        ...
        resolve: {
            auth: ['dgAuthService', '$q', '$location', function(dgAuthService, $q, $location)
            {
                var deferred = $q.defer();

                dgAuthService.isAuthorized().then(function(authorized)
                {
                    if(authorized)
                        deferred.resolve();
                    else
                        deferred.reject();
                },
                function(authorized)
                {
                    deferred.reject();
                });

                return deferred.promise;
            }]
        }
    });
}]);
````
